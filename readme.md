# TODOs:

## Req before being happy with personal use
- Make sure lookup damage by combatant works
- Should enemies die?
- Check if deaths are handeled
- remove weird character before others' names
- Show classes&specs in ACT
- Understand why true isCrits don't show up as crits
- Handle zones
- Fix logs element emojis
- Find a way to name encounters instead of them ending up as "Encounter" (because no allies?)

## Req before pubbing on github
- Review AssemblyHelper
- Review all of the vibe code, esp. packet nerdery
- Give PacketCaptureHelper it's offline timer back
- Double checks longs vs ulongs
- Wtf is FindEnumerableOfType
- Wtf is PacketBinaryReader
- Make sure unexpected catches are logged

## Pubbing

- pub on github
- contact ACT devs for ACT pub

## Bonus
- i18n?

- proper translation for monster names and skill names
